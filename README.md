# SImpleRestService
A simple example of an application of the interaction of the rest-architecture in java and javacript. A little more than just a CRUD application. The bottom line: there are trade unions, there are members of these trade unions, there are membership cards and payments.

## Java:
### Stack: 
  Spring-boot, Spring-Data, Spring-Security (+ jwt), validation (commons-validator + small examples of custom validation), PostgreSQL

* *resources/db__V1* - database initialization file,
* For convenience, Swagger is connected

## JavaScript:
Small UI implementation, main components taken from Devextreme
* Stack: React, Hooks
